     * This program uses a serial connection to connect to a FONA 3G GSM board.
     * The connection uses AT commands, which are a bit sensitive to completing.
     * 
     * Starts by taking in a com port number or device id of some sort.
     * 
     * It prompts for a telephone number and a simple single line message.
     * 
     * This simple program starts by send the basic AT<cr> command and looking
     * for an OK in the last line of the response.  For some reason, mine also
     * repeats some of the commands - it does here, for instance.
     * An OK not found means we terminate.
     * 
     * Then it uses the AT+CMGS to send the text message to the number given,
     * again, looking for some prompts, although it doesn't always get anything
     * back as the program is too quick.
